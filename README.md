# Introduction

Hello! This is the github repository for the observational  component of [Geostrophically Constrained Flow of Warm Subsurface Waters Into Geometrically Complex Ice Shelf Cavities](https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.22541/essoar.170594141.13133501/v1) . 

Important files:
	1. fullrun.py is an example of how to run the full code 
	2. cdw.py (poorly named sorry) does most of the manipulation of the hydrographic data 
	3. bathtub.py (whimsically named I don't apologize) does alot of the bathymetric and geometric work
	4. HUB.py just one function calculate the hub
	5. graph.py contains the graphing
	
Input data you'll need:
	- BedMachine 2: https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0756/versions/2
	- hydrographic data: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.nodc:NCEI-WOA18
	- measures definitions: https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0756/versions/2#anchor-1

If you are interested in running or just have questions reading the software please reach out to me at gdf@ucla.edu it would make my day!
