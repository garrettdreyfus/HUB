# Introduction

Hello! This is the github repository for the observational  component of [A Predictive Theory for Heat Transport Into Ice Shelf Cavities](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GL108196) . 

Important files:

	- fullrun.py is an example of how to run the full code 
	- cdw.py (poorly named sorry) does most of the manipulation of the hydrographic data 
	- bathtub.py (whimsically named I don't apologize) does alot of the bathymetric and geometric work
	- HUB.py just one function calculate the hub
	- graph.py contains the graphing
	
Input data you'll need:

	- BedMachine 2: https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0756/versions/2
	- hydrographic data: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.nodc:NCEI-WOA18
 
	- measures definitions: https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0756/versions/2#anchor-1

If you are interested in running or just have questions reading the software please reach out to me at gdf@ucla.edu it would make my day!
